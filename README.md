What Is Neural AI?
Neural AI is a next-generation AI enhancement mod for Garry’s Mod that replaces traditional scripted NPC behavior with intelligent agents powered by neural networks. Instead of following rigid routines, NPCs observe, learn, and adapt to their environment—and to you.

Whether you're running a roleplay server, creating a custom map, or just experimenting, Neural AI makes every encounter feel unique, responsive, and unpredictable.

Core Features
🧠 Adaptive Behavior
NPCs don’t just follow paths—they assess situations and choose actions based on context:

Patrol intelligently, avoiding obstacles and hazards
Switch between aggressive, defensive, or evasive tactics
Remember dangerous areas and share that knowledge with allies
🤝 Shared Knowledge System
All neural NPCs on the map share a global memory:

If one NPC learns a location is dangerous, others avoid it
Successful strategies (e.g., flanking routes) can be adopted by the group
Knowledge persists across sessions when saved
⚙️ Real-Time Learning
NPCs improve through experience:

Learn from combat outcomes (e.g., “shooting from cover works better”)
Adjust aggression based on player behavior
Fine-tune movement and targeting over time
Learning can be toggled per-NPC or globally—ideal for performance tuning on servers.

🎯 Dynamic Decision-Making
Each NPC evaluates its surroundings every frame to decide:

Should I chase the player or hold position?
Is this enemy too strong? Should I retreat?
Is there a better weapon or vantage point nearby?
Decisions are probabilistic, not deterministic—so no two playthroughs are identical.

👥 Team Coordination (Optional)
With compatible maps or addons, NPCs can:

Form squads and assign roles (scout, assault, support)
Call for backup when overwhelmed
Flank enemies using coordinated movement
(Note: Full squad logic requires additional configuration or companion mods.)

🛠️ Server & Creator Friendly
Fully configurable via in-game console commands or config files
Adjustable difficulty: from docile bots to hyper-aware hunters
Low overhead mode disables learning for large-scale battles
Works with most existing NPC types (npc_combine_soldier, npc_zombie, etc.)
Use Cases
PvE Maps: Create challenging, evolving enemy waves
Roleplay Servers: Add intelligent guards, civilians, or creatures
Training Scenarios: Test tactics against adaptive opponents
Machinima & Experiments: Generate emergent, cinematic moments
Performance & Compatibility
✅ Compatible with all major GMod gamemodes (Sandbox, DarkRP, TTT, etc.)
✅ Supports both single-player and multiplayer
⚡ Optimized for performance: learning scales with server settings
🔌 No dependencies beyond standard Garry’s Mod content
Tip: For best results, limit active neural NPCs to 10–20 on average servers. Use the built-in “learning off” mode for large crowds.

Get Started
Install the Neural AI addon via Steam Workshop or manually
Spawn any supported NPC (they’ll automatically become “neural”)
Watch as they explore, react, and evolve
No scripting required—just play, and let the AI surprise you.
